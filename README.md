# Project: Industrial Process Monitoring, Control, and Visualization System

_This project is under active development._

## Overview
This project implements a SCADA-inspired monitoring and analytics system for an industrial thermal process. A physics-based energy balance model is used to simulate process behavior, compute efficiency KPIs, and visualize operational data for both operators and management.

## System Architecture
- Process simulation (thermal system surrogate)

## Process Model
The process is modeled using a first-order energy balance equation representing a boiler or thermal tank. This model captures key operational behaviors such as heat input, thermal losses, and flow-based energy transfer.

Key variables:
- Temperature
- Heat input
- Flow rate
- Efficiency

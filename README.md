# Project: Industrial Process Monitoring, Control, and Visualization System

_This project is under active development._

## Overview
This project implements a SCADA-inspired monitoring and analytics system for an industrial thermal process. A physics-based energy balance model is used to simulate process behavior, compute efficiency KPIs, and visualize operational data for both operators and management.
